# Task 7 (CI)

You need to setup [Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) which runs tests for every commit to repository.

1) Create Github repository
2) Place code from previous task there
3) Rewrite you code to work in Node.js environment (without browser). See example here: https://gist.github.com/soheilhy/867f76feea7cab4f8a84 (read "Installing Mocha" and "Testing a Library")
4) Create Github action that runs your tests (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-nodejs-or-python)
